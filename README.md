<h1 align="center">asn1go - Decoding ASN1 library</h1>
</p>

This library can validate and decoding ASN1 value annotation files (used by eSIM Profile).
And since we like ASN1 as much as all other devs, the library can only do that and nothing more.

# Features
- [ ] Scan ASN1 value annotation files
- [ ] Validate and decode
- [ ] Generate Go representation of the decoded value
- [ ] Validate and encode against ASN1 Definition
- [ ] Generate DER encoded value
