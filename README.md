<h1 align="center">asn1go - Decoding ASN1 library</h1>
</p>

This library can validate and decoding ASN1 value annotation files (used by eSIM Profiles).
And because we like ASN1 as much as any other developer, the library can only do this and nothing more.

# Features
- [ ] Scan ASN1 value annotation files
- [ ] Validate and decode
- [ ] Generate Go representation of the decoded value
- [ ] Validate and encode against ASN1 Definition
- [ ] Generate DER encoded value
